### Map Objects
- Upload multiple images (PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF) as layered objects — stored as UUID files on disk

- Photoshop-style layer panel with z-index ordering
- Per-object: rename (double-click), GM visibility toggle (👁), player visibility toggle (📺), right-click context menu for lock/reorder/delete
- Select objects on canvas with transform handles — move, scale from corners (9px handles), rotation support
- Grid snapping: center-snap objects to grid cell centers (right-click grid → Snap Objects to Grid)
- Draw Grid Size: draw a rectangle matching a known grid cell to calibrate grid (shows green preview with px size)
- GIF support for animated elements (water, fire, etc.)
- Objects persisted in database (`map_objects` table) — survive page reload
- Objects synced to player display in real-time via SSE `objects:update` event
- Dual visibility: objects can be visible to GM only, player only, both, or neither
- New objects default to hidden from player (visible to GM only)

### Camera Viewport

- Area outside camera dimmed in GM view
- Camera persisted in database (`camera_x/y/w/h` on session) — survives page reload
